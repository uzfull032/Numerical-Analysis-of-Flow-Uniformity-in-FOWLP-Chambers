Abstract </h5>
Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging (FOWLP) is an advanced packaging technology that supports the high integration and miniaturization of semiconductor devices. In thermal processes such as soft bake, chamber-internal flow behavior plays a critical role in determining wafer temperature uniformity and process reliability. While most previous studies have focused on material properties and thermal stress, quantitative evaluations of flow characteristics inside chambers are limited. This study conducts steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using ANSYS Fluent to investigate the effects of inlet geometry (hole or slit) and the presence or absence of a baffle structure on internal flow. Velocity and pressure distributions across the wafer surface are analyzed to assess flow uniformity. The results show that baffle placement and chamber geometry significantly affect flow stability and distribution. This work provides fundamental insights for optimizing chamber designs and identifies key flow variables essential for achieving uniform thermal processing in wafer-level manufacturing systems.
